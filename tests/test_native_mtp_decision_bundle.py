"""One device round-trip per verify cycle, with the accept decision on device.

Recreates the shape of MTPLX's decode loop, which reads back a single small
"decision bundle" holding sampled tokens, drafts and accept flags rather than
pulling ids to the host and comparing in Python. vMLX paid two blocking syncs
per cycle (sampled ids, then draft ids) and compared host-side with the GPU
idle -- and raw-harness timing put the engine at ~66ms/cycle against the same
model's ~55ms/cycle without engine machinery.

The decisive property here is EQUIVALENCE: the fused path must produce exactly
the accepted count the host-side comparison produces, for every prefix shape.
