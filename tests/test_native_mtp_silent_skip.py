"""A bundle that DECLARES MTP must never be skipped silently.

MEASURED on the box: Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-JANG_4M ships 34
``mtp.layers.0.*`` tensors and ``num_nextn_predict_layers=1``, but family
``nemotron_h`` is not in the runtime-supported set, so the loader deactivated
MTP and returned with NOTHING at INFO. The model ran plain autoregressive and
the only surfaces that told the truth were ``/health.mtp`` and the CLI startup
banner. Decode-time ineligibility is DEBUG-only, so nothing mentioned it either.

Silence about a feature the bundle advertises is the defect.
