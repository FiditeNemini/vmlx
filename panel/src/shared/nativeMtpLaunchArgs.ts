/**
 * Native in-model MTP: ONE user decision, two values.
 *
 *   'off'      — plain autoregressive decode (AR). The bundle's MTP head is
 *                loaded nowhere; the engine receives --disable-native-mtp.
 *   'adaptive' — the engine's adaptive speculative policy. It starts every
 *                request at the bundle's capability ceiling, measures the
 *                completed verify-cycle cost against its own AR baseline, steps
 *                the draft depth down (D3 -> D1 -> AR) when a window loses,
 *                re-probes with backoff, and promotes back when the deeper rung
 *                wins. The request/bundle sampler is never changed: greedy
 *                requests use identity verification, sampled requests use
 *                rejection-sampling acceptance (`compatible-only`).
 *
 * There is deliberately NO user-facing depth (D1/D2/D3), no "fixed" policy and
 * no "deterministic" greedy override any more (Eric, 2026-10-04: "users no
 * longer have adaptive/d1/d2/d3 buttons but only ar (mtp off) and adaptive
 * mtp"). The engine keeps `--native-mtp-depth N --native-mtp-depth-policy
 * fixed` as a measurement lever for benchmarks; the app never emits it.
 *
 * Legacy persisted values ('auto', 'deterministic', nativeMtpDepth,
 * nativeMtpDepthOverride, nativeMtpAutoSamplingPolicy) are read-only history:
 * 'auto'/'deterministic' normalize to 'adaptive'; the depth/override/sampling
 * fields are ignored everywhere. A saved deterministic session therefore
 * stops forcing temperature 0 on every request — that enforcement was a
 * sampler clamp hidden inside an MTP control.
