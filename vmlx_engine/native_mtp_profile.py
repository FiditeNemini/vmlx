"""Session-scoped validated depth profiles for adaptive native MTP.

The per-request wall-value controller (native_mtp_adaptive) starts every
request at the configured depth and needs tens of verify cycles before its
runtime-cost and acceptance gates can conclude that MTP is slower than AR.
Because ``MLLMNativeMTPState`` is request-local, every request repeated that
whole failed experiment: short and first turns finished before the controller
learned anything, and later turns relearned the same lesson from scratch.

Contract (audited 2026-08-28):

- The only honest first-turn guarantee is AR. An UNKNOWN or unvalidated
  profile does not activate MTP at all; no user request is sacrificed to a
  speculative experiment or a periodic re-probe.
- MTP may seed immediately only from MEASURED evidence: either a validated
  model-local tuning record (vmlx_mtp_tuning.json best_depth, resolved by
  native_mtp_effective_depth and flagged by the caller) or a profile entry
  this store learned from completed requests whose measured per-depth
  wall value beat the same requests' own AR baseline.
- Learning requires completed requests (stop/length) with at least
  ``MIN_WALL_SAMPLES`` wall-clock samples at the winning depth. Cancelled,
  errored and sample-starved requests teach nothing. Acceptance rate alone
  never promotes — only confirmed-tokens-per-wall-second versus the AR
  baseline, with a hysteresis margin.
- The store lives on the generator instance, so a model/bundle/config reload
  or a new engine process starts clean. Cross-process persistence of
  measured depth remains the tuning-sidecar mechanism.
- Keys separate sampler class, restored-prefix, context bucket, and
  tools-present so materially different workloads cannot poison one another.
- Nothing here changes sampling, verification, or emitted tokens: it only
  chooses whether MTP activates and at what STARTING depth; the existing
  controller and safety gates still adjust with their own measurements.
